## Executive Summary

Introducing an intelligent AI automation application that demonstrates solving real-world operational challenges while advancing our sacred mission. The BSC AI Agent pilot showcases how cutting-edge artificial intelligence can reduce administrative burden, optimize resource allocation, and enhance student satisfaction through intelligent agentic automation in the cloud.

Built on n8n's professional workflow automation platform with OpenAI's advanced language models, the system is built to handle digital support inquiries automatically while maintaining complete data security through private Azure PostgreSQL storage within BYU-Idaho's tenant environment. The pilot demonstrates measurable operational benefits including elimination of wait times for routine inquiries, significant reduction in part-time staffing requirements, and data-driven service improvements that directly address historically low email satisfaction scores.

## Background

This work is the representation of two independent projects occuring in parallel for different use cases, one being an internal IT AI automation project (exlusively piloted with n8n), and the other developed on TeamDynamix iPaaS (legacy low-code BYU-Idaho system) aimed to automate BYU-Idaho's support emails with simple web requests.

The experience developing similar solutions using separate platforms offered an insightful contrast. n8n is purpose-built for developing AI powered automation solutions, while TeamDynamix remains constrained to more simplified worklow automations. The amount of time required to build an AI automation solution in n8n compared to building it in a traditional legacy platform like TDX iPaaS is a stark contrast. TeamDynamix iPaaS is undoubtedly a powerful automation framework, however it wasn't built for AI projects. 

Across the automation landscape, we’re seeing a pronounced divide in both philosophy and outcomes. Some vendors—Zapier, Make, and n8n, for example—recognized the growing importance of AI early on and made bold investments in intelligent frameworks. This forward-thinking approach hasn’t just set them apart technically; it’s also positioned them to capture emerging opportunities as demand for AI-driven automation accelerates.

On the other hand, companies that doubled down on legacy architectures and took a conservative approach to AI—like TeamDynamix with their iPaaS offering—are experiencing the consequences. By hesitating to embrace generative AI, they’ve missed key windows for innovation and are now finding it increasingly difficult to deliver solutions that meet the evolving expectations of their customers. Legacy systems like iPaaS simply weren’t built with the flexibility or extensibility needed for seamless AI integration, which creates substantial roadblocks for developing modern, automated workflows.

Among the new generation of platforms, n8n particularly stands out. Their deep integration with cutting-edge AI frameworks—specifically, LangChain—enables both advanced automation capabilities and rapid iteration as the AI landscape evolves. This foundational bet on robust, open, and extensible AI technologies is what sets n8n and similar platforms on a clear path toward sustained relevance and success, while legacy solutions risk being left behind.

## Strategic Recommendation  

Instead of being built with TDX iPaaS (from the original proposal), we recommend building the BSC Agent on the n8n platform and the procurement of an enterprise n8n license, enabling university-wide implementation of intelligent automation that supports our mission to serve more students affordably while maintaining high-quality education and spiritual development opportunities.
